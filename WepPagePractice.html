    <h2>Working on Layout Style</h2>
    <p>This page is for me to practice working on HTML elements and attributes. I can practice different ways to lay text and content. I am working on retaining the uses of tags and proper layout with things like flex-box and padding. I want to make aesthetically pleasing web pages and applications, then moving on to mobile applications and hopefully games.</p>

    <h2>Visual Layout</h2>
    <p>In order to achieve these type of creative applications, I will have to master CSS which will allow me to position and align elements in unique ways. I am able to control text appearance as well as the placement of media. With these two elements involved is how dynamic webpages are started. </p>

    <h2>Javascript Implementation</h2>
    <p>The final piece to the puzzle is Javascript which allows for web responsiveness. It basically goes from being nice to look at to becoming a functioning page that can send data and store information such as usernames and passwords. Of course there is more to web development, but we will leave that for another practice webpage.</p>
